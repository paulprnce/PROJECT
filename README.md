Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting bioethanol yield (g/L) from lignocellulosic biomass using machine learning and presenting the results through a professional, interactive web dashboard.

The system integrates:

-A trained regression model for ethanol yield prediction

-Process-aware input constraints to reflect real fermentation conditions

-An interactive Streamlit-based web interface with modern visualizations

-The goal is to support process optimization, decision-making, and educational insight in bioethanol production.

🎯 Objectives

-Predict ethanol concentration based on biological, chemical, and operational parameters

-Avoid unrealistic predictions using domain-informed constraints

-Visualize fermentation process health and product distribution

-Deploy the model as an accessible web application

⚠️ Disclaimer

This tool is intended for educational and research purposes.
Predictions are based on historical and simulated data and should not replace industrial-scale process validation.
